# Preliminary Collections Analysis

Looking at the 'Status' of loans that are labeled past due and in centralized collections, we see in Fig. 1 there 
are a total of 1301 loans that fit this criteria. The loans are bucketed by the days late, as reported by Infinity 
in the data dump for 12/17/2020.

**Figure 1: Number of loans that fall into the days late buckets.**

In Fig. 2, we look at the total amount due in each bucket, divided into interest, fees, and pricipal due.

Taking the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2, Fig. 3 shows the average amount due per loan in the buckets.

After a loan has been in collections, it may be returned to 'Active' status, but still bares the label of 
'Centralized Collections'. There are 430 such loans as of 12/17/2020. Fig. 4 shows how many loans that are active or 
past due have been sent to centralized collections. These loans are compared by the date that they were sent to 
collections. The buckets do NOT represent how many days late the loan is, as the active loans are currently 0 days late.

since the loans were sent to centralized collections.**

In Fig. 5, the current total due for active and past due labeled centralized collectios are compared.

In Fig. 6, the data from Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are used to determine the average total due for each loan bucket.
